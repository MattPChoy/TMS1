Things to test for:

KEY: if X is present as the first character of the line, test and main code has been implemented.

X - 1) Returns the correct ID in a normal case;
  - 2) Out of scope if the int is too large?

X - 1) If intersection is created when ID is a sensible value (covered by getId1)
X - 2) If intersection is created when ID is an empty string literal
X - 3) If intersection is created when ID is null

> getConnections()
X - 1) What if there are no incoming routes? Is it meant to return an empty list?
X - 2) Test what happens if there are incoming routes.
